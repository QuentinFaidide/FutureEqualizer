This eq computes harmonics from the 3rd peaking eq frequency with 4 Range Modes and let you tweak the gain and resonance as you want.
Four modes are available using the range knob:
-first quarter: Boost one octave above.
-second quarter: Boost with a 3-notes major chord and one octave.
-third quarter: Boost with a 3-notes minor chord and one octave above.
-last quarter: Boost one and two octave above.
