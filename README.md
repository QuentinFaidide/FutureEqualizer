## What is this plugin for ?
This equalizer plugin is useful for mastering, but it works for mixing too.
The particulary of this eq is a function which calculates harmonics from the 3rd peaking eq with 4 Range Modes and let you tweak the gain and resonance (or q) just as you want.

## Harmonics ? What For ?
This "harmonics function" was created because a lot of producers are boosting at like 2000hz and 4000hz (1 octave) and claim to have a cleaner sound.
Four modes are available using the range knob:
-first quarter: Boost one octave up.
-second quarter: Boost with a 3-notes major chord and one octave up.
-third quarter: Boost with a 3-notes minor chord and one octave up.
-last quarter: Boost one and two octave up.

## Is it finished ?
Finished but not polished. The UI isn't optimal for me yet.

## Can I read the code, steal it, sell it ?
"GNU General Public License" speak for itself.
