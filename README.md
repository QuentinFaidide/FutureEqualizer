This eq computes harmonics from the 3rd peaking eq frequency with 4 Range Modes and let you tweak the gain and resonance as you want.
Four modes are available using the range knob, first quarter: replicate 3rd filter one octave above, second quarter: replicate 3rd filter with a 3-notes major chord and one octave above, third quarter: replicate 3rd filter with a 3-notes minor chord and one octave above, last quarter: replicate 3rd filter one and two octave above.
